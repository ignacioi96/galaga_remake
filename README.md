# galaga_remake
An old project that I made as a side project as I ventured into my first ever programming course CPSC 110. Still incomplete -and maybe not the best programming language-, but super fun to work on. I was a remake of the very classic arcade game Galaga. To play the game open the file, run the code with (main START-WORLD).
